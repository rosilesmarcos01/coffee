## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working?

   - Look for: "FCM Token obtained: ..."

2. **Check Permissions**:
   - Chrome: Settings â†’ Privacy â†’ Site Settings â†’ Notifications
   - Make sure your site is "Allowed"

3. **Check Service Worker**:
   - F12 â†’ Application tab â†’ Service Workers
   - Should see `firebase-messaging-sw.js` registered and active

### Common Issues

- **"Messaging not supported"**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
