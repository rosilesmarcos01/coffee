3. Paste your site URL (e.g., `https://coffee-delivery-app.vercel.app`)

## Check if HTTPS is Working

Open browser console (F12) and check:
- The URL should start with `https://` (not `http://`)
- No security warnings
- Service worker registered successfully

## Test in Incognito/Private Mode

Sometimes cached permissions cause issues:
1. Open your app in **Incognito/Private window** (Cmd+Shift+N in Chrome)
2. Try enabling notifications
3. This will show if it's a permission cache issue

## Alternative: Test Locally First

If production isn't working, test locally:

```bash
cd /Users/marcosrosiles/WORK/MR-INTEL/hola-enfermera/coffee-delivery-app
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 and test notifications there.
